/**
 * The one combination of these settings that loses DATA rather than money.
 *
 * Every other knob here trades cost against restore speed. This pair does not:
 * a transaction lands in L0 first and is only safe to sweep once level 1 has
 * merged it, so an `l0-retention` shorter than the level-1 interval deletes
 * transactions that were never copied anywhere else. Nothing would report it —
 * litestream keeps replicating happily, every metric stays green, and the loss
 * only surfaces the day someone actually restores.
 *
 * It is easy to reach by accident precisely because the two values are tuned
 * for opposite reasons: slowing compaction is what saves the money, and the
 * retention is the number one forgets to move with it. Hence a boot-time
 * refusal rather than a line of documentation — the README already said it, and
 * a README cannot fail a deploy.
