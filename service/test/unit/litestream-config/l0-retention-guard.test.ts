// --- The one setting here that loses DATA, not money -------------------------
// Every other knob trades cost against restore speed. `l0-retention` against the
// level-1 interval does not: a transaction lands in L0 first and may only be
// swept once level 1 has merged it, so too short a retention deletes writes that
// were never copied anywhere else. Nothing reports it — litestream keeps
// replicating, every metric stays green, and the loss surfaces the day someone
// restores. And it is easy to reach BY ACCIDENT, because the two values are
// tuned for opposite reasons: slowing compaction is what saves the money, and
// the retention is the one you forget to move with it.
