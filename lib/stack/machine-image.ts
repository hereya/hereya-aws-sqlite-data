// The instance AMI is PINNED (see CLAUDE.md invariant 12). Moving it replaces
// the production database VM, so it moves only when a human bumps the constant
// — never because AWS published something. The pin and the check that tells us
// it has fallen behind (`npm run check:ami`) live together in ../ami-pin.ts.

/**
 * The VM's AMI — pinned by default, on purpose.
 *
 * `MachineImage.latestAmazonLinux2023()` re-resolves "the newest AL2023" at
 * EVERY deploy. AWS publishes one roughly monthly, so the next deploy after a
 * publication — of ANYTHING, including an unrelated connector release — hands
 * the launch template a different ImageId, and the rolling update
 * (`minInstancesInService: 0`) terminates the production database VM to apply
 * it: ~60 s with no Data API for every org, at a moment nobody chose. Same
 * shape as the artifact-hash incident of 2026-07-29/30 (CLAUDE.md inv. 11).
 *
 * So the id is a constant. It moves when someone bumps `PINNED_AMI_ID` or
 * passes `amiId`, i.e. on a dated, announced deploy. The accepted trade-off:
 * OS security patches no longer ride in by accident — they arrive when we
 * roll the pin, which the daily scan surfaces. `amiId=latest` restores the
 * old auto-resolving behaviour (surprise roll included).
