// The AMI pin protects the production database VM from being replaced by an
// unrelated deploy (CLAUDE.md invariant 12). Its cost is that OS patches stop
// arriving on their own, which is only acceptable if something NOTICES that the
// pin has fallen behind.
//
// Regression guarded: that "something" was prose in two documents for weeks and
// was never executed once — on 2026-08-03 a sweep found an image four weeks
// old. These tests pin the properties that make the replacement (a command with
// an exit code) trustworthy: it must not report health when it cannot see, and
// it must tell a behind PIN apart from an un-rolled DEPLOY, because the two
// have different fixes.
