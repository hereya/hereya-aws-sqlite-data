// The artifact hash decides when the PRODUCTION database VM is replaced (the
// update policy is terminate-before-launch, so a roll = ~1 min with no Data
// API). These tests pin the property that makes that acceptable: the hash
// tracks what the service IS, not how many times it was built.
//
// Regression guarded: until 2026-07-30 the asset hash was computed on the
// bundling output (`service.tar.gz`), which is not reproducible — `builtAt`
// plus tar/gzip mtimes made every build differ. The launch template therefore
// changed on every deploy of anything, and CloudFormation rolled the databases
// five times in forty hours without a single change to this service.
